__Due date:__ <%= homework_due_date %>


This page contains information about the __final project__ and the memo I want you to write as the first part of the project.

The [final project info page](/homework/final-project)

* The TOC

## Deliverables

__Due date:__ <%= homework_due_date %>. The final project will be due on finals week (there is no final exam).

Create a folder in your `compjour-hw` repo named: `final-project`.

For this assignment, create a file named: __memo.md__




## Final project guidelines

For the final project, I want you to find and research an existing public data problem, and __do something better__. Not necessarily _bigger_, but more _considered_. The general archetype is to collect from some data dump/listing and then create a more filtered, purposeful view of a topic.

Consider this project equal amount of research, design, and coding; take some time to look over existing websites and datasets, try to _use_ them as a consumer. Then think about what make the existing sites clunky/difficult to use, and think about _one core feature or service_ that you could extract and focus on.


#### It must be public-facing

(i.e. on the web and linkable, not in some zip folder you email me)

#### Deals with a public issue

#### Uses public data

#### You can work with a partner

The [CongressEdits project is such an example](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/automating-transparency/), taking the massive dump of Wikipedia edits data and joining it with a list of known IP addresses.

The source of your data can be on just about any public civic topic. Check out the data topics in the [Search-Script-Scrape](http://www.compjour.org/search-script-scrape/) exercises for data ideas. [There's also data.gov](http://www.data.gov/), though making a useful filtered-subset of [that is a project in itself](https://thomaslevine.com/!/socrata-summary/).

Some ideas:

- Is there a better way to let [people know of food and drug recalls](http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/)? Either of up-to-date events, or past history? 
- Or car recalls? Here's [the search page](http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/owners/SearchSafetyIssues). Here's [the raw data](http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/downloads/flatfiles.cfm).


__Big examples in the wild:__ These are professional projects that are probably beyond our scope, but are examples of news apps

[ProPublica's TireTracker](http://projects.propublica.org/tires/)


[Inside the Firewall: Tracking the News That China Blocks](https://projects.propublica.org/firewall/) - a nice example of an app that piggybacks off of an ongoing large data effort ([Greatfire.org](https://en.greatfire.org/)) and filtering for a subset (just news sites).

[Politwoops](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/politwoops) - deleted tweets


[previously, on arrested development](https://apps.npr.org/arrested-development/) - not really a civic app, but a [great example of manual data gathering](http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/214042/how-npr-made-its-arrested-development-graphic-we-like-to-build-useful-stuff/).

[HealthSherpa](https://www.healthsherpa.com/) - a startup born from the disastrous Healthcare.gov launch. [Here's the data they used](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-plan-information/).

## Memo guidelines




Hypothetical examples here:

- [I Heart NY Museums](/homework/project-memos/iheartnycmuseums) (this is obviously not the subject focus we care about) (the [memo on Github](https://github.com/compjour/compjour-class-site/blob/master/source/homework/project-memos/iheartnycmuseums.md))
- [Dollars for Docs](/homework/project-memos/dollarsfordocs) (the [memo on Github](https://github.com/compjour/compjour-class-site/blob/master/source/homework/project-memos/dollarsfordocs.md))


__You must have these subsections in your memo:__

(feel free to add URLs/images as needed)

#### Quick pitch

A description of your project, in 140-characters or less.

#### The old way

Whatever need your project fulfills, something else has fulfilled it in some way before, albeit poorly. Describe __in a step-by-step list__ what people have to do now to get the information/insight/etc that your project purports to deliver.

#### The new way

Now describe, step by step, how people will use your project to find information/insights in a (hopefully) more expedited/streamlined fashion.


#### Where does the data come from? How is it collected?

Where does the data for your project come from (i.e. the government, an agency, a company, your head)? How are you collecting it?

#### What data-cleaning/processing needs to be done?

You're presumably turning that data into something more visible/usable. Describe what kind of things you're doing to the raw data (i.e. sorting it, cleaning it up, adding it with other data, such as geocoding data from Google).

#### How will the data be stored?

If you're collecting/processing the data, are you storing it somewhere on disk, such as a text file or database? What data format are you using? Or type of database?



#### Who else has done it and how is your attempt better?

Have other people tried to do what you've done? How is your attempt better?

#### Pre-mortem

Read [this article about pre-mortems](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem). Basically, pretend it's the day after the due date and your project didn't live up to expectations. List the reasons why that is, i.e., anticipate the difficult parts of your project.
