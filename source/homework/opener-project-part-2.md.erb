## fetch-and-unpack-twitter-data.py

This script performs the unglorious task of downloading a zipfile from a URL and unzipping its contents to a folder. When it's done its job, inspect the contents of `data-hold/`

<%= codepiece 'opener-project/fetch-and-unpack-twitter-data.py' %>




## read-sunlight-csv.py

The first data file [comes courtesy of the Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/#legislator-spreadsheet): it's a spreadsheet (CSV file) that contains information on every current and recent Congressmember, and more helpfully, their unique identifiers to other data sources, such as FEC filings and social networks.

In this script, we use the `csv` module to create a collection of `Dict` objects, so that we can access the attributes more easily of each row (i.e. Congressmember).

<%= codepiece 'opener-project/read-sunlight-csv.py' %>

The output:

~~~
There are 894 Congressmembers listed
There are 539 active Congressmembers
There are 55 active Congressmembers from CA
There are active CA Congressmembers from CA on Twitter
