__Due date:__ <%= homework_due_date %>



Create a folder in your `compjour-hw` repo named: `final-project`.

By Monday, I want to know:

1. __What progress you've made so far:__ what data you've collected, what you've cleaned, organized, etc. I recommend keeping code/notes in your repo. I often do this when trying to figure out a dataset ([here's a quick memo I wrote for Iowa's liquor sales data](https://gist.github.com/dannguyen/18ed71d3451d147af414))


2. __What roadblocks you've run into__: is there any changes to your overall plan?

3. A cocktail-napkin quality sketch/mockup of what your page will look like. I don't care if you Instagram a pencil sketch. Just draw at least the front page/main view of your project.
