## What is Git and Github?

__Git__ is a program used to __track changes__ in a file directory. Think of it as a streamlined, automated way to keep a version history of all the ways you add, modify, or delete files from a file directory

__Github__ is an online service that uses Git to let developers quickly publish and maintain their code on the web. Git's version-tracking features makes it a natural framework for developers to collaboratively work on the same project without accidentally deleting/overwriting each others' work.

__Git__ and __Github__ are two fundamentally different things, and you can use Git without using Github. However, for the purposes of this class, we will always be using Git and Github together.


## Why Github?

Github serves as an easy, painless system for backing up your work. Not just the current state of it, but all past revisions of it. This means you don't have to create files/backup folders such as `draft-of-final-project.py` and `final-draft-of-final-project.py` because you're afraid that some old version code may come in handy later on; Github (via git) takes care of that.

It also makes it easy to publish your work on the web. And to distribute it. When you push your code repositories (aka __repos__) onto Github, anyone with access to your repos  can make a complete copy &ndash; hence, again, why [Github is so dominant in the code hosting/publishing domain](http://www.wired.com/2015/03/github-conquered-google-microsoft-everyone-else/).

For the purposes of this class, Github makes it easy for you to keep track of your work, and easy for me to grade it. Github has an API which makes it easy for me to automate the checking of your repo activity.
