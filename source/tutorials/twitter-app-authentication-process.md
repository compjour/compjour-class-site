title: Twitter App Authentication Process
---


Quick walkthrough of how to create a Twitter app using your main Twitter account, and have it be used by your secondary accounts.


By __main Twitter account__, I mean, _the Twitter account that has been authenticated and tied to your phone number_ &ndash; because Twitter won't let you create apps from a Twitter account without phone verification.

By __secondary accounts__, I mean any other Twitter accounts you may have created that haven't been tied to a working phone number.




### 1. Create a new app with your main account

From your __main twitter account__ , visit https://apps.twitter.com/app/new to create a new app.

After the app is created, click the __"Key and Access Tokens"__ tab. And note the values of __Consumer Key (API Key)__ and __Consumer Secret (API Secret)__.

### 2. Login with a secondary account via a different browser

Now open an __entirely new browser__. So if you used Google Chrome to log in as your __main account__, use Firefox (or Internet Explorer, or Safari, or, more conveniently, [create a new user profile for Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en))
