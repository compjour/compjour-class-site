We will learn how to use the Chrome DevTools to debug webpages and, by doing so, gain a better understanding of how the Web (and computers) work, as well as gain experience in using an invaluable tool for web-scraping and other programming.

TK: More text about what's going on in these instructions:


## Opening the DevTools Panel

You can open the DevTools by going to the menu and selecting __View -> Developer -> Developer Tools__.

Or better yet, use the keyboard shortcut:

__PC:__ <kbd class="kbd">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd">Shift</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd">I</kbd> / __Mac:__ <kbd class="kbd">Cmd</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd">Opt</kbd>+<kbd class="kbd">I</kbd>

### Go horizontal

Usually by default, the panel will open up vertically. This isn't an ideal layout for most web debugging tasks, so click-and-hold the layout icon (in the top right of the __DevTools Panel's menubar__) to see the horizontal-layout option.

### Pop-out

There's also a __pop-out option__, which is what I normally use. For the purposes of the animated-GIF-screencasts in these tutorials, I stick to the horizontal layout.

### The menubar

The menubar contains three menu items that we care about:

- Elements
- Network
- Console

### Disabling the cache

By default, your web browser saves copies of webpages and their files to a __cache__ on your hard drive, so that when you visit next time, the browser reads from the cache, which is much faster than re-fetching the files across the Internet.

However, we don't want that convenience, at least for the purposes of debugging the browser operations. So click the little __Gear icon__ on the DevTools menubar and select the __Disable cache__ option.
