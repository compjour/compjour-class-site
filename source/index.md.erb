# Computational Journalism
## Stanford COMM 177A/277A

If all you know is how to write something and then where to point it.

There's no big picture here. Some of the details we'll cover are pedantic. But we aim to demystify the

People would definitely interact with software differently if they knew something about whether their personal data is “secure.” But there are several other things that everyone should—and does not—know, such as civic knowledge or even more basic understandings of other educational topics like logic, science, etc. For most, software is just another black box that they will happily coexist with, and that’s OK.

The core is: Why we do things.
