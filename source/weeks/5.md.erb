Read [The Bot Bubble: How Click Farms Have Inflated Social Media Currency](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/121551/bot-bubble-click-farms-have-inflated-social-media-currency) by the *New Republic's*Doug Bock Clark.

Questions to answer:

1. What are the basic steps used by botmakers to avoid spam detection?
2. Why is it so difficult to stop spammers?
3. Technical issues aside, and cynically speaking, why would Facebook and other social networks *not* do more to prevent spammers.
4. Technical issues aside, why would social networks want to root out spammers?
5. Come up with 5 metrics not listed in the article to block spammers that are reasonable to implement.

### Random notes


Peter Norvig ([director of research at Google](http://research.google.com/pubs/author205.html)) wrote a [Python solution for the When is Cheryl's Birthday logic puzzle](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Cheryl.ipynb). It's a perfect example of how a programming solution is typically much longer and convoluted than the pen-and-pencil solution. Nonetheless, it demonstrates how logical principles can be stated as programmatic functions, so it's a nice demonstration for all the times when abstracting a problem *is* the right path.
