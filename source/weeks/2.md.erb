## Wars or Bars

An unavoidable &ndash; and _necessary_ &ndash; effect of data is __that it simplifies the world__. This is important to remember when conducting or consuming any kind of data task, whether it be analysis, collection, or visualization. We must always ask: _what is being simplified_, or more to the point, _what is lost in oversimplification_?

Take a data point that is ubiquitous in its acceptance and use: __age__. This data point is defined by the number of whole years since your recorded birth date. But it's used by society to define your level of maturity, such as when you're ready to go to wars, or bars. And the cutoff is binary: as soon as the exact second of your 21st birthday hits, you're suddenly assumed to be responsible enough to drink.

With __buckets__ (a.k.a. _binning_, or _clustering_), the simplification becomes even more pronounced. In the three decades from when you turn 18, you are [_the_ demographic for TV advertisers to cater to](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings#Demographics). And again, when the clock strikes on your 50th birthday, you're suddenly less valuable.

As we design visualizations and projects around data, our goal will be to simplify. But realize that not everyone will agree with our simplification.



## Data is indeed the plural of anecdote

via [Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/):


> You may have heard the phrase the plural of anecdote is not data. It turns out that this is a misquote. [The original aphorism, by the political scientist Ray Wolfinger](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2011/04/the-plural-of-anecdote-is-data-after-all.html), was just the opposite: The plural of anecdote is data.
> 
> Wolfingerâ€™s formulation makes sense: __Data does not have a virgin birth__. It comes to us from somewhere. Someone set up a procedure to collect and record it. Sometimes this person is a scientist, but she also could be a journalist.


When information comes as "data" &ndash; even in the physical dressing of a spreadsheet &ndash; it is no more inherently truthful or relevant than number shouted by a sackcloth-wearing man on the corner. At the very least, though, purported data should have a _collection_ process or methodology. Knowing about this process should be a key point of your research and planning.

The _process_ can be something as mundane as _the form (paper or electronic) used to record the data_ and how often the data is recorded.
