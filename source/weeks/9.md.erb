The [final project info page is here.](/homework/final-project) I'll use it as the landing page for listing tools and tips.

### Mmm data

Still desperate for ideas? Some things I found this weekend:

- [50 years of storm event data from the national weather service](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp)
- [800MB of store-level liquor sales for Iowa](https://gist.github.com/dannguyen/18ed71d3451d147af414)
- [Texas sex offender registry](https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/SexOffender/), in which you have to sign up as a [sex-offender-registry-downloader](https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/SexOffender/PublicSite/Application/Export/History.aspx) in order to get it.
- [All of Texas's 130,000+ inmates](http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/info_services.html) (click "High Value Datasets", it's an Excel file)
- [All of Florida's inmates](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/obis_request.html)
