## What is a news application?


[News Apps at ProPublica via the Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/delivering_data_2.html):

> A news application is a big interactive database that tells a news story. Think of it like you would any other piece of journalism. It just uses software instead of words and pictures.

> By showing each reader data that is specific to them, a news app can help each reader understand a story in a way that’s personally meaningful to them. It can help a reader understand their personal connection to a broad national phenomenon, and help them attach what they know to what they don’t know, and thereby encourage a deep understanding of abstract concepts.
