San Francisco compensation data: [as filed by Michael Morisy of MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/san-francisco-141/san-francisco-employee-pay-database-17079/)

Great example of a public records request, asking for something that has already been released (see the data [as released on SF's data portal](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Employee-Compensation/88g8-5mnd)).
