### Grading

The allocation of points can be found on the [Homework page](/homework). The scale is set at the standard __A:__ 90%, __B:__ 80%, etc.

#### Attendance

Though I will be posting notes on the site and web development is often a job done just fine remotely, I expect you to physically be in class barring any extreme circumstances.

For every session in which I've marked you absent, __10 points__ will be docked from your grade.
